I want to remake and improve this application. I like many of the aspects of it, but I am not a fan of the look and 
  feel or the fact that it's an app that only stores data in localstorage.  I'd like you to come up with a PRD that 
  covers what features there are, how things are laid on, and the functionality. I would prefer if the document be 
  written concise enough that a developer could follow it exactly, but that there isn't any specific language, platform, 
  style, or architecture decisions made.  They can be referenced commonly, but I would prefer if the document does not 
  make an idiomatic decisions about such things.  Please ask me any questions you may have before generating this.  I 
  would also prefer if you not only generate the PRD, but anything else you can generate that would make the transition 
  and handoff easier would be great.

  =========

  Most of the features aren't there. Please check the 
  original documents in claude-requirements.md, then review your code to see if the features are there. if they aren't, then implement them.  In 
  its current state, I can't even add anything new.  None of the buttons works, the cards aren't draggable, there is no 
  tablet/pc view...the list goes on and on.  This needs a heavy rework
