Review codebase at https://github.com/johnvilsack/vtasks. Pay specific attention to the README.md, requirements.md, and build.md. I want you to build a comprehensive requirements guide prompt I can use to feed to AI for it to one-shot the building of this application. In your build guide, I want it be programming language, framework, and platform agnostic, so that the AI will select the best tools for the job. I want any aspects of the style and color scheme to be noted as "Optional" so that I can ask the AI to either select it's own design aesthetic or I can provide it a custom one in the initial prompt. Any design documentation should include the ability to have dark/light modes. I want the layout section to be specified in a similar fashion. Optimally, I want the design of the UI to be responsive, with the ability to toggle between a compact, mobile device single pane mode and a expanded tablet/desktop version with a sidebar for input and management aspects and a main content area for card management. I want you to be descriptive about the data structure, but agnostic on platform and execution. The documentation indicates the user of localstorage, but I am interested in pivoting away from that. 
To make the app more tidy, Perhaps its best to add a settings icon button that has Toggle Desktop/Compact mode, Import Data, Export Data
I do like the aspect of the current app that data is hydrated on the client side for most of the functionality. I want to keep it like that if possible.  I'd also like there to be a search function
Please be as descriptive as possible and structure the format as appropriately as you can for optimal AI use. This can even be a structured data format if you'd like. I trust you to make the best call.

The last time you tried this, you seemed to have structural design aspects of the application.
  What I'm referring to is that there are specifics in the existing repo that include the nesting of fields on New Note/Task creation to a button that is anchored to the right side of the text box? Then layouts of the cards are also fairly specific, with icons appeaaring for key functions, the same as the detail modals?  I feel that we can specifically call out such functionality without offering specific "style if exactly this way" guidance.
I would include anything that seemingly is out of the oridinary for the design of a Vite/Tailwind application or associated components.  Of course, Vite/Tailwind is only to be used as a reference point for your analysis, not the final documentation since that will be agnostic.
