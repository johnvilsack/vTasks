Consider "Stash" - A place where you can store tasks note snoozed but do not want in active tasks.  A place to pull from where there is nothing else to do
WYSIWYG Editor for Details field?
On popup details card, the ability to inline edit without jumping to a form.
A projects tab - the ability to group all tasks by collapsible project view so that You can see what all needs to be done for a project
Pre-requisites - Specifically in a project, a task that can't be done until another task has been completed.  This might mean we need card stacking?
Notes should not have a Due Date
Stash Tab
Settings?
  Should auto-sort be a setting?
  Priority
  Unsnoozed at top
  What other settings does the AI believe we could have?
inline editing
markdown on text box
auto url parsing on text in text box
search - be able to search all active items. Instant parsing to show all known cards in search results
Styling the cards a bit differently.  Tasks should look normal.  Snoozed tasks should lightly colored in their background. Completed tasks lightly greyed out.  
Animations - Snoozed tasks coming back should animate to show they are reappearing.  This should happen only when the page is reloading or in focus.
Snoozed tasks should pop to the top of the active tasks list.
If select new date for snooze, reset clock to 8am
Can we do tags or types for cards? A card might be a project, but it might also be a type.  Like, Maybe I want to have types of systems, applications, etc.  This should be the same class of sorting and surfacing as Priority and Project. It would be different than the current Type (noet/task) we have now, so come up with a different name or classification.
Add Tablet/Desktop View. We need a mobile view for mobile devices and management, but a nice tablet view with sidebar and main content area would be great.  Should be able to toggle between the two and possibly make it automatic if that's possible.
